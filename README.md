# JOT

# What is JOT?

Jot is essentially a notes superspace. It will enable users to make notes in a single place and it will use some of the modern goodies to make it one of a kind.

# How is JOT different from other notes?

JOT can:

1. Categorize & Organize the notes based on the user preference
2. Allow user to customize their notes.
3. Reduce the manual effort of creating redundant notes for different topics
4. Provide timely reminders to:
   a. Revise a summarized version of the notes
   b. Take a quiz
5. Link notes with each other

# Technologies used for JOT development:
